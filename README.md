Rotating CCG Parser
=========

This is the implementation of incremental CCG parser described in "CCG Parsing Algorithm with Incremental Tree Rotation" by Stanojević and Steedman NAACL 2019.

Installation
---------------

Before you can use this parser you need to make sure that some prerequisites are installed on your machine.

Basic requirements:
- a recent version of some c++ compiler with c++11 and pthreads support (for example gcc4.8.1+)
- cmake
- JDK 8 (Scala requires JDK >=8 but DyNet at the moment has problem with JDK >=9) you MUST set JAVA_HOME variable
- git client
- mercurial client

If you want to use the pretrained model that uses ELMo you will also need to make sure you have:
- python3
- pip3 install 'scikit-learn==0.22.1' 'allennlp==0.4.2' 'thrift==0.11.0'

If that is all in place, you can run the following command to install the rest of the dependencies:

     ./scripts/install_dependencies.sh

It will take some time before its finished installing all the other dependencies (Scala, SBT, SWIG, Eigen and DyNet) and store them in directories `dependencies` and `lib`.

Now you need to compile all the files by running the following command:

    ./dependencies/sbt/bin/sbt assembly
    
Unzip the pretrained model with:

    unzip model.zip
    
And finally, use it to parse file input.sentences and store trees in new file output.trees:

    ./scripts/run.sh edin.ccg.MainParse \
               --model_dirs model \
               --beam-parsing 1 \
               --input_file input.sentences \
               --output_file output.trees

On the first run it may take longer to start because it will download be downloading ELMo models, but afterwards it should be relatively fast. If you want a really fast (but less accurate) CCG parser you should go for EasyCCG instead.

Output
------
Since this is a transition based parser constrained by a grammar, it may enter into deadends during the greedy search for the correct parse. In that case it connects all the elements on the stack under right branching binary nodes labelled GLUE.
C&C `generate` evaluation program will not be able to handle that kind of derivations. To do evaluation with `generate` first a small transformation is needed to replace GLUE nodes with some type-changing rules. Script located in `./scripts/parsing_tools/candc_evaluate.sh` does that.
If you want to do evaluation with Hockenmaier style dependencies then GLUE nodes present no problem and you can run `./scripts/run.sh edin.ccg.MainEvaluate` with appropriate parameters instead.
